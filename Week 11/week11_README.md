# Week 11 - Custom Theming

1.Create a backup copy of your site before making changes (make sure your child theme is included in your backup)

2. Choose a color scheme for your site (links in materials)

3. Choose a background image for your site (links in materials). You can use a pattern or image.
4. Create a copy of the header template (header.php) from your parent theme manually or using a plugin
5. Customize the header template. (Example: Add a different logo or homepage banner). Make this change only show on the front page, where all other pages use the unchanged header. Hint: You will be using the Wordpress is_front_page() conditional tag.
6. Using your newly picked color scheme, edit your style.css and adjust colors to match your color scheme. Customize the header font colors, borders, gradients, background colors, etc. (You do not have to customize all of these, I am just listing out ideas.)
7. Set up your child theme to use your newly picked background pattern or image.
8. Upload your changes when you are done and make sure your Child Theme is activated.

**Attach a zip file of the theme!**
